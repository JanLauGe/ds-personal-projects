The Scottish Crossbill (**Loxia scotica**) is a small passerine bird that 
inhabits the Caledonian Forests of Scotland, and is the only terrestrial 
vertebrate species unique to the United Kingdom. Only ~ 20000 individuals of 
this species are alive today.

The first step is to get occurrence data for the species we are interested in.
This used to be the main challenge in Biogeography. Natural Historians such as
Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Alexander von Humboldt would travel
for years on rustic sail ships around the globe collecting specimen. Today, 
we are standing on the shoulders of giants. Getting data is fast and easy 
thanks to the work of two organisations:

- [the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/),
an international network and research infrastructure funded by the worldâ€™s 
governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about 
all types of life on Earth.

- [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), a non-profit initiative that has developed 
an ecosystem of open source tools, we run annual unconferences, and review 
community developed software.

# Cute finces with funny beaks don't only occur in the Galapagos islands
# (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2)


# THIS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN ONCE!
# convert scientific (Latin) name to gbif taxon ID
# (Good to avoid synonyms, which are common with english species names)
speciesKey <- rgbif::name_backbone('Loxia scotica')$speciesKey

# get the occurrence records of this species
gbif_response <- occ_search(
  scientificName = "Loxia scotica",
  country = "GB",
  hasCoordinate = TRUE,
  hasGeospatialIssue = FALSE,
  limit = 9999)
# backup to reduce API load
write_rds(
  x = gbif_response,
  path = here::here('data/gbif_occs_loxsco.rds')
)
# # to read file back in:
# gbif_response <- read_rds(path = here::here('data/gbif_response_loxsco.rds'))
```


GBIF and rOpenSci just saved us years or roaming around the highlands with a 
pair of binoculars, camping in mud, rain, and snow, and chasing crossbills 
through the forest. Nevertheless, it is still up to us to make sense of the
data we got back, in particular to clean it, as data collected on this large
scale can have its own issues. Luckily, GBIF provides some useful metadata
on each record. Here, I will exclude those that

* are not tagged as "present" (they may be artifacts from collections)
* don't have any flagged issues (nobody has noticed anything abnormal with this)
* are under creative commons license (we can use them here)
* are older than 1965


```{r data cleaning}
# look at a random sub-sample of the data (100 rows)
# we can see there is a lot of information on each record!
gbif_response$data %>%
  sample_n(100) %>% 
  View()

birds_clean <- gbif_response$data %>%
  # get decade of record from eventDate
  mutate(decade = eventDate %>% 
           ymd_hms() %>% 
           round_date("10y") %>%
           year() %>%
           as.numeric()) %>%
  # clean data using metadata filters
  filter(
    # # only classified as present
    # occurrenceStatus == "present" &
    # # only records with no issues
    # issues == "" &
    # # only creative commons license records
    # str_detect(license, "http://creativecommons.org/") &
    # # no records before 1965
    decade >= 1970 &
    # no records after 2015 (there is not a lot of data yet)
    decade < 2020) %>%
  # retain only relevant variables
  # (note: select is a name conflict between the raster package the dplyr.
  # I am therefore explicitly calling dplyr::select here)
  dplyr::select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, decade) %>%
  # sort by decade
  arrange(decade)

```


Okay so we've got clean data now. Here comes the nifty trick. We want to look
at the data in subsets by decade in order to see if and how the spatial 
distribution of the species has changed over time. To do so, we can "nest"
data in a list column using the `tidyr` package:

```{r}

birds_nested <- birds_clean %>%
  # define the nesting index
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  # aggregate data in each group
  nest()

# let's have a look
head(birds_nested)

```

The species data needs some further transformation before we can use it in this 
project. Let's extract the decade of the records from the date field using the
`lubridate` package. Now that the data is cleaned we can also exclude a lot of 
the metadata shift our focus to the spatial information. This is given as 
latitude and longitude but since we're only looking at the UK (and because
our environmental data is from the UK Met Office), we should transform this to
a UK grid projection. This is easily done using the `sp` package. If you want 
to learn more about map projections you can check out 

TODO: enter xkcd reference and a good link

```{r}

# latlon crs reference
proj_latlon <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")
proj_ukgrid <- CRS("+init=epsg:27700")

birds_nested <- birds_nested %>%
  # make records into spatial points
  mutate(points = map(
    .x = data, 
    .f = ~ SpatialPoints(coords = .x, proj4string = proj_latlon) %>%
      # reproject spatial points to the UK grid
      # (this is so it matches our climate data)
      spTransform(CRSobj = proj_ukgrid)))

```


We also need climate data for our analysis. I have prepared this separately
based on a dataset provided by the UK Met Office. It is nested in the same way
as the bird data (although I admit that nesting weather seems slighly less
straight forward than nesting birds).

TODO: should include reference to this course:
